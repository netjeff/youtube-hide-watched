# youtube-hide-watched

A simple userscript for toggling visibility of watched videos in YouTube.

# Installation

- Install TamperMonkey or GreaseMonkey extension for your browser
- Visit https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/13040-youtube-hide-watched-videos and hit the Install button
- Visit YouTube (or refresh the YouTube page if it's already open)

# How to Use

The script adds a small button at the top of the page. Pressing the button cycles through showing watched videos normally, then dimmed, then entirely hidden.  

The button remembers the most recent choice seperately for each of these areas of YouTube: 
- Subscriptions page 
- Channel pages
- Trending page
- Recommendations sidebar when watching a video
- Everywhere else

The button is at the top of the page to right of the Search box.
